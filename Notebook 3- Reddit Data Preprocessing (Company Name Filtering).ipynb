That's the huge key that allows covid restrictions to have such impact- because people fear the interpersonal spread. \\n\\nYes heart disease and hunger are also incredibly deadly, but people don't spread those to each other. That's why the government doesn't focus on them so much (at least that's what people will think, anyway). The fear of catching/spreading is what allows covid to be so powerful.\n",

And the Spanish flu lasted 3 years without a vaccine. It's now part of the seasonal flu. People got back to normal after that as, as I've been saying for so long is that this won't last forever. It has changed things for now, but if people continue to bend over to the whim of the changes their governments enforce in stealth or under the guise of some bullshit, things will change massively forever, long after covid is a threat. And then when questions are asked, it will all be too late. \\nAnd when vaccinated people can still transmit the virus, without the need for testing they can just scan their codes and off they go into a football ground. Can you tell me the logic that means passports will stop the spread? Or do anything to change the state we are in for that matter?\n",

I don't mean this in a smug way, but this report is overall extremely encouraging for the vaccine, though you certainly zeroed into the one stat which is unfavorable to the vaccine.\\n\\nFirst off, I will gladly concede that the vaccine does not seem to be offering people long-term protection against getting COVID infection.  This report clearly shows that, and we've seen data from Ireland and Israel that confirms as well.  I know your instinct will be to dismiss this statement I'm about to make, but I encourage you to really think about it:\\n\\nEven if a vaccine does not offer meaningful protection against contracting a disease does not mean it does not significantly reduce the spread of this disease.  Catching a disease and spreading it are two different things.\\n\\nThe spread and impact of a disease is a function of severity and duration of symptoms, which this report lays out very clearly:\\n\\n# Hospital Admissions\\n\\n|Age|Vax|Unvax|Delta|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|18-29|1.7|11.1|6.5x|\\n|30-39|2.1|17.4|8.2x|\\n|40-49|3.6|29.0|8x|\\n|50-59|5.8|40.7|7.1x|\\n|60-69|10.1|60.3|6.0x|\\n|70-79|18.8|78.3|4.2x|\\n|80+|37.4|112.9|3x|\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# Death\\n\\n|Age|Vax|Unvax|Delta|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|18-29|0.1|0.4|4x|\\n|30-39|0.2|1.3|6.5x|\\n|40-49|0.6|3.9|6.5x|\\n|50-59|1.3|11.8|9.1x|\\n|60-69|4.0|26.9|6.7x|\\n|70-79|10.5|56.9|5.4x|\\n|80+|40.8|129.4|3.2x|\\n\\n# Transmission\\n\\nA person is contagious when their viral load gets high - which is usually accompanied by symptoms.  Since unvaccinated people are clearly having more severe symptoms, and for longer, it's reasonable to assume that, on average, they are contributing *more* to the spread of the disease, which means that the vaccine is clearly reducing transmission.\\n\\nThe vaccine is not perfect, but like the initial polio vaccine - it's good enough for now.\n",

Why be upfront about the vaccine's limitations? People want easy answers. And they'll pay handsomely for them, especially when they should know better.\n",

       "7777427    Note: I did a more organized write up of this [here](https://medium.com/@interlucid/aris-take-academy-streaming-and-instagram-growth-is-it-worth-it-4c90c27a74ca)\\n\\n2019-08-15: I bought the course a while ago and I started running ads this morning. So far I'm getting decent results as far as cost per click and such. The course made it very easy to get started with Facebook Ad Manager and to know where to target your ads for highest impact. Right now I have 7 monthly listeners on Spotify.\\n\\nEdit 2020-08-01: The first time I ran ads I didn't have super great targeting so I paused my ads for a few months. When I started them again I fixed my targeting and I'm getting much better results although there is still room for improvement on my end.\\n\\nThings that helped me specifically:\\n- Use videos that have me in them\\n- Cut out countries from my audience if they don't convert to listeners (compare Facebook clicks with Spotify listeners)\\n- Use genres instead of similar artists\\n- Advertise songs that got at least 7.0 on Crowd Review\\n\\nYour results may vary. Likely you'll have to change different things for your own brand.\\n\\nCurrently each Spotify follower costs me around $1.25. I'm not advertising Instagram but for each $1.00 I spend I get around 1 Instagram follower as well. This is higher than commonly advertised follower growth companies but these followers aren't bots, they're real people who message me and interact with posts and share content. I'm also still in the process of optimizing my ads; my goal is to get down to $0.15 per follower. Costs are also higher currently due to the surge in online marketing and uncertain markets that resulted from Covid-19.\\n\\nI've been running ads with the $1.25 cost with a $10/day budget for a little over a month and in that time my Spotify monthly listeners went from around 500 to around 1300 (this number fluctuates a lot so it's not a great indicator of growth). A better indicator is follower count, which went from around 200 to 540 followers in the same period.\\n\\nMy artist name is Interlucid if you want to check it out/compare it in Spotify for Artists to see long term growth.\\n\\nIf this information helped you I'd really appreciate it if you listened to my music. Follow me if you liked it, if not send it to a friend who you think would like it. I hope I could help you a bit on your journey and best of luck!\n",

I actually just got home from the physical.  When you factor in no rent, no food, no car payment, no car insurance, no electric bill, no internet bill...the math was simple.  My $15/hr job leaves me with about $7/hr after all my bills.  Also, you need to consider that this is a 7 day a week job while you're on the ship, so you're going to do 40 hours at $8, then another 30 at $12.    You're looking at ~$680 a week with no bills.  (that's $17/hr for a 40 hour week if you don't want to math).  \\n\\nUpdate a year later - I completed my first contract, ended up in Provisions instead of the galley.  I had a great time.  The “low pay” was a non-issue. I spent most of the contract earning $9.60/hr and left the ship with just over $13,000 in my savings account.  After just 5 months. Good luck doing that on land. My return date was canceled due to Covid, but I can’t wait to go back.  Hawaii is amazing.\n",

A lot has changed since then, I lost my job partly due to procrastination, moved out of California back to  shitty Ohio. met a very beautiful woman had a nice relationship with that I eventually ruined because of procrastination... hit me really hard so I turned my life around, I barely procrastinate anymore and get so much done. I've started a business which I hope it would take off soon (sans the covid-19 bullshit). my method? no magic, no self help book, no theories and no thinking. it came from simply summoning up the courage and will to face reality and pull every bit of strength I have into doing everything that I need to do. constantly keeping in mind that if I am not doing what I need to do there's a train that is getting further and further away from me until I will never be able to catch it. knowing that I have such little limited time on earth and I have no excuse to no do the things I need to do. just developing a burning sense of urgency to get things done, because after all this is about survival. and Nobody is responsible for your survival but yourself, the world could give a rats ass what happens to you, after all you're one of 7.8 billion on earth fighting and clawing for very limited resources. no room for wishy washy thinking, this is survival at its core.\n",

The wiki also mentioned I might have things like clairvoyance because of it.\\n\\nThe second power was layer reinforcement, it lets me change how hard things are without effecting weight or mobility. Using it I can make barriers out of air, sharpen things, increase striking damage, increase my durability and those of my cat minions.\\n\\n Problem is there is a lack of quantifiers on my powers, reading the wiki my layer reinforcement could potentially make me near indestructible as well as my weapons and my cat minions.  My speed is just listed as incredibly fast, and reactions at bullet dodging.  No idea how fast I really am though, I could still be slower than a bullet and dodge them.  \\n\\nDoubt I could take any S tiers unless I'm near light speed fast and the reinforcement gets me to tanking hits from superman, but most under that are going to be in for a fight. \\n\n",

I don't mean this in a smug way, but this report is overall extremely encouraging for the vaccine, though you certainly zeroed into the one stat which is unfavorable to the vaccine.\\n\\nFirst off, I will gladly concede that the vaccine does not seem to be offering people long-term protection against getting COVID infection.  This report clearly shows that, and we've seen data from Ireland and Israel that confirms as well.  I know your instinct will be to dismiss this statement I'm about to make, but I encourage you to really think about it:\\n\\nEven if a vaccine does not offer meaningful protection against contracting a disease does not mean it does not significantly reduce the spread of this disease.  Catching a disease and spreading it are two different things.\\n\\nThe spread and impact of a disease is a function of severity and duration of symptoms, which this report lays out very clearly:\\n\\n# Hospital Admissions\\n\\n|Age|Vax|Unvax|Delta|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|18-29|1.7|11.1|6.5x|\\n|30-39|2.1|17.4|8.2x|\\n|40-49|3.6|29.0|8x|\\n|50-59|5.8|40.7|7.1x|\\n|60-69|10.1|60.3|6.0x|\\n|70-79|18.8|78.3|4.2x|\\n|80+|37.4|112.9|3x|\\n\\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# Death\\n\\n|Age|Vax|Unvax|Delta|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|18-29|0.1|0.4|4x|\\n|30-39|0.2|1.3|6.5x|\\n|40-49|0.6|3.9|6.5x|\\n|50-59|1.3|11.8|9.1x|\\n|60-69|4.0|26.9|6.7x|\\n|70-79|10.5|56.9|5.4x|\\n|80+|40.8|129.4|3.2x|\\n\\n# Transmission\\n\\nA person is contagious when their viral load gets high - which is usually accompanied by symptoms.  Since unvaccinated people are clearly having more severe symptoms, and for longer, it's reasonable to assume that, on average, they are contributing *more* to the spread of the disease, which means that the vaccine is clearly reducing transmission.\\n\\nThe vaccine is not perfect, but like the initial polio vaccine - it's good enough for now.</td>\n",

So far I'm getting decent results as far as cost per click and such. The course made it very easy to get started with Facebook Ad Manager and to know where to target your ads for highest impact. Right now I have 7 monthly listeners on Spotify.\\n\\nEdit 2020-08-01: The first time I ran ads I didn't have super great targeting so I paused my ads for a few months. When I started them again I fixed my targeting and I'm getting much better results although there is still room for improvement on my end.\\n\\nThings that helped me specifically:\\n- Use videos that have me in them\\n- Cut out countries from my audience if they don't convert to listeners (compare Facebook clicks with Spotify listeners)\\n- Use genres instead of similar artists\\n- Advertise songs that got at least 7.0 on Crowd Review\\n\\nYour results may vary. Likely you'll have to change different things for your own brand.\\n\\nCurrently each Spotify follower costs me around $1.25. I'm not advertising Instagram but for each $1.00 I spend I get around 1 Instagram follower as well. This is higher than commonly advertised follower growth companies but these followers aren't bots, they're real people who message me and interact with posts and share content. I'm also still in the process of optimizing my ads; my goal is to get down to $0.15 per follower. Costs are also higher currently due to the surge in online marketing and uncertain markets that resulted from Covid-19.\\n\\nI've been running ads with the $1.25 cost with a $10/day budget for a little over a month and in that time my Spotify monthly listeners went from around 500 to around 1300 (this number fluctuates a lot so it's not a great indicator of growth). A better indicator is follower count, which went from around 200 to 540 followers in the same period.\\n\\nMy artist name is Interlucid if you want to check it out/compare it in Spotify for Artists to see long term growth.\\n\\nIf this information helped you I'd really appreciate it if you listened to my music. Follow me if you liked it, if not send it to a friend who you think would like it. I hope I could help you a bit on your journey and best of luck!</td>\n",

When you factor in no rent, no food, no car payment, no car insurance, no electric bill, no internet bill...the math was simple.  My $15/hr job leaves me with about $7/hr after all my bills.  Also, you need to consider that this is a 7 day a week job while you're on the ship, so you're going to do 40 hours at $8, then another 30 at $12.    You're looking at ~$680 a week with no bills.  (that's $17/hr for a 40 hour week if you don't want to math).  \\n\\nUpdate a year later - I completed my first contract, ended up in Provisions instead of the galley.  I had a great time.  The “low pay” was a non-issue. I spent most of the contract earning $9.60/hr and left the ship with just over $13,000 in my savings account.  After just 5 months. Good luck doing that on land. My return date was canceled due to Covid, but I can’t wait to go back.  Hawaii is amazing.</td>\n",

I've started a business which I hope it would take off soon (sans the covid-19 bullshit). my method? no magic, no self help book, no theories and no thinking. it came from simply summoning up the courage and will to face reality and pull every bit of strength I have into doing everything that I need to do. constantly keeping in mind that if I am not doing what I need to do there's a train that is getting further and further away from me until I will never be able to catch it. knowing that I have such little limited time on earth and I have no excuse to no do the things I need to do. just developing a burning sense of urgency to get things done, because after all this is about survival. and Nobody is responsible for your survival but yourself, the world could give a rats ass what happens to you, after all you're one of 7.8 billion on earth fighting and clawing for very limited resources. no room for wishy washy thinking, this is survival at its core.</td>\n",

My speed is just listed as incredibly fast, and reactions at bullet dodging.

That's the huge key that allows covid restrictions to have such impact- because people fear the interpersonal spread. \\n\\nYes heart disease and hunger are also incredibly deadly, but people don't spread those to each other. That's why the government doesn't focus on them so much (at least that's what people will think, anyway). The fear of catching/spreading is what allows covid to be so powerful.   \n",

And the Spanish flu lasted 3 years without a vaccine. It's now part of the seasonal flu. People got back to normal after that as, as I've been saying for so long is that this won't last forever. It has changed things for now, but if people continue to bend over to the whim of the changes their governments enforce in stealth or under the guise of some bullshit, things will change massively forever, long after covid is a threat. And then when questions are asked, it will all be too late. \\nAnd when vaccinated people can still transmit the virus, without the need for testing they can just scan their codes and off they go into a football ground. Can you tell me the logic that means passports will stop the spread? Or do anything to change the state we are in for that matter?   \n",

I don't mean this in a smug way, but this report is overall extremely encouraging for the vaccine, though you certainly zeroed into the one stat which is unfavorable to the vaccine.\\n\\nFirst off, I will gladly concede that the vaccine does not seem to be offering people long-term protection against getting COVID infection.  This report clearly shows that, and we've seen data from Ireland and Israel that confirms as well.  I know your instinct will be to dismiss this statement I'm about to make, but I encourage you to really think about it:\\n\\nEven if a vaccine does not offer meaningful protection against contracting a disease does not mean it does not significantly reduce the spread of this disease.  Catching a disease and spreading it are two different things.\\n\\nThe spread and impact of a disease is a function of severity and duration of symptoms, which this report lays out very clearly:\\n\\n# Hospital Admissions\\n\\n|Age|Vax|Unvax|Delta|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|18-29|1.7|11.1|6.5x|\\n|30-39|2.1|17.4|8.2x|\\n|40-49|3.6|29.0|8x|\\n|50-59|5.8|40.7|7.1x|\\n|60-69|10.1|60.3|6.0x|\\n|70-79|18.8|78.3|4.2x|\\n|80+|37.4|112.9|3x|\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# Death\\n\\n|Age|Vax|Unvax|Delta|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|18-29|0.1|0.4|4x|\\n|30-39|0.2|1.3|6.5x|\\n|40-49|0.6|3.9|6.5x|\\n|50-59|1.3|11.8|9.1x|\\n|60-69|4.0|26.9|6.7x|\\n|70-79|10.5|56.9|5.4x|\\n|80+|40.8|129.4|3.2x|\\n\\n# Transmission\\n\\nA person is contagious when their viral load gets high - which is usually accompanied by symptoms.  Since unvaccinated people are clearly having more severe symptoms, and for longer, it's reasonable to assume that, on average, they are contributing *more* to the spread of the disease, which means that the vaccine is clearly reducing transmission.\\n\\nThe vaccine is not perfect, but like the initial polio vaccine - it's good enough for now.   \n",

       "7777427  Note: I did a more organized write up of this [here](https://medium.com/@interlucid/aris-take-academy-streaming-and-instagram-growth-is-it-worth-it-4c90c27a74ca)\\n\\n2019-08-15: I bought the course a while ago and I started running ads this morning. So far I'm getting decent results as far as cost per click and such. The course made it very easy to get started with Facebook Ad Manager and to know where to target your ads for highest impact. Right now I have 7 monthly listeners on Spotify.\\n\\nEdit 2020-08-01: The first time I ran ads I didn't have super great targeting so I paused my ads for a few months. When I started them again I fixed my targeting and I'm getting much better results although there is still room for improvement on my end.\\n\\nThings that helped me specifically:\\n- Use videos that have me in them\\n- Cut out countries from my audience if they don't convert to listeners (compare Facebook clicks with Spotify listeners)\\n- Use genres instead of similar artists\\n- Advertise songs that got at least 7.0 on Crowd Review\\n\\nYour results may vary. Likely you'll have to change different things for your own brand.\\n\\nCurrently each Spotify follower costs me around $1.25. I'm not advertising Instagram but for each $1.00 I spend I get around 1 Instagram follower as well. This is higher than commonly advertised follower growth companies but these followers aren't bots, they're real people who message me and interact with posts and share content. I'm also still in the process of optimizing my ads; my goal is to get down to $0.15 per follower. Costs are also higher currently due to the surge in online marketing and uncertain markets that resulted from Covid-19.\\n\\nI've been running ads with the $1.25 cost with a $10/day budget for a little over a month and in that time my Spotify monthly listeners went from around 500 to around 1300 (this number fluctuates a lot so it's not a great indicator of growth). A better indicator is follower count, which went from around 200 to 540 followers in the same period.\\n\\nMy artist name is Interlucid if you want to check it out/compare it in Spotify for Artists to see long term growth.\\n\\nIf this information helped you I'd really appreciate it if you listened to my music. Follow me if you liked it, if not send it to a friend who you think would like it. I hope I could help you a bit on your journey and best of luck!   \n",

I actually just got home from the physical.  When you factor in no rent, no food, no car payment, no car insurance, no electric bill, no internet bill...the math was simple.  My $15/hr job leaves me with about $7/hr after all my bills.  Also, you need to consider that this is a 7 day a week job while you're on the ship, so you're going to do 40 hours at $8, then another 30 at $12.    You're looking at ~$680 a week with no bills.  (that's $17/hr for a 40 hour week if you don't want to math).  \\n\\nUpdate a year later - I completed my first contract, ended up in Provisions instead of the galley.  I had a great time.  The “low pay” was a non-issue. I spent most of the contract earning $9.60/hr and left the ship with just over $13,000 in my savings account.  After just 5 months. Good luck doing that on land. My return date was canceled due to Covid, but I can’t wait to go back.  Hawaii is amazing.   \n",

A lot has changed since then, I lost my job partly due to procrastination, moved out of California back to  shitty Ohio. met a very beautiful woman had a nice relationship with that I eventually ruined because of procrastination... hit me really hard so I turned my life around, I barely procrastinate anymore and get so much done. I've started a business which I hope it would take off soon (sans the covid-19 bullshit). my method? no magic, no self help book, no theories and no thinking. it came from simply summoning up the courage and will to face reality and pull every bit of strength I have into doing everything that I need to do. constantly keeping in mind that if I am not doing what I need to do there's a train that is getting further and further away from me until I will never be able to catch it. knowing that I have such little limited time on earth and I have no excuse to no do the things I need to do. just developing a burning sense of urgency to get things done, because after all this is about survival. and Nobody is responsible for your survival but yourself, the world could give a rats ass what happens to you, after all you're one of 7.8 billion on earth fighting and clawing for very limited resources. no room for wishy washy thinking, this is survival at its core.   \n",

Just like most things back then, they used religion to keep from dying of disease (God loves you for keeping his cleanliness rituals).\\n\\nAlso - you'd eat the smartest non-human (the covid line of birds) but not a kangaroo?

I could make armies of days do my bidding making cute internet videos.  It said any cat so I might be able to have an army of big cats.\\n\\nPower generator gave me corvid physiology, so I can turn into a jackdaw, or a crow.  Unidan is my bitch, I can use him in fights by altering my covid form and starting an argument about which it was.  The wiki also mentioned I might have things like clairvoyance because of it.\\n\\nThe second power was layer reinforcement, it lets me change how hard things are without effecting weight or mobility. Using it I can make barriers out of air, sharpen things, increase striking damage, increase my durability and those of my cat minions.\\n\\n Problem is there is a lack of quantifiers on my powers, reading the wiki my layer reinforcement could potentially make me near indestructible as well as my weapons and my cat minions.  My speed is just listed as incredibly fast, and reactions at bullet dodging.  No idea how fast I really am though, I could still be slower than a bullet and dodge them.  \\n\\nDoubt I could take any S tiers unless I'm near light speed fast and the reinforcement gets me to tanking hits from superman, but most under that are going to be in for a fight. \\n   \n",
